# Test to demonstrate different behaviour in PEG.js master

This repository contains a test that identifies a difference in behaviour
between PEG.js master and the 0.7.0 release.

To run the test:

    npm install -g mocha
    npm install
    mocha -R spec

On master, this will fail with: `AssertionError: expected no exception to be
thrown, got "Expected "&", ".", "AND", "[" or [ \t\f] but "a" found.`

On 0.7.0 release, this will pass.

The full stacktrace is below:
